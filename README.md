## Introduction

The current experiment investigates how a rule-based variable and a statistics-based variable influence AGL performance
### ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR LEARNING PARADIGM (AGL)

* #### Application
  AGL is used to investigate various areas in cognitive psychology, such as implicit learning, contrast between rules and similarity, pattern recognition, categorization.

* #### Implementation
  Prepare an formal grammar (AG): most researchers used a finite state grammar

* ##### Training Phase:
  * Participants will observe/memorize a set of items generated by the AG
  * Participants will not be told that strings follow certain rules

* ##### Test Phase:
  * A list of new items is generated. X% follows the AG (Grammatical-G) and 1-x% does not (Ungrammatical-UG)
  * Participants will be told that training strings follow a certain grammar but not details of the grammar
  * Participants will be asked to determine whether new items are G or UG

* ##### Transfer Setting
Learning items and test items involve different modularities.
i.e. The learning session uses letter sequences and the test session uses color sequences.

* ##### Normal Results:
  * Participants exhibit above chance accuracy
  * Participants could not articulate how they make grammaticality judgments.

* ##### Various Interpretations
    * Rule-Based Interpretations
        * Participants have learned complete or partial of the original grammar ([Reber,1967](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/replaced_scanned_articles/reber67_scanned.pdf),[1969](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-12199-001), [1989](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/pdfs/reber89.pdf))
        * Participants have learned a set of propositional rules with the form {Feature -> Grammaticality} ([Dulany, et al, 1984](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/pdfs/dulany84.pdf))

            Feature refers to a chunk of symbols. Grammaticality refers to "Grammatical" or "Ungrammatical"

            i.e. A participant might learned that items with the chunk "XV" are always grammatical and establishes the rule {"XV" -> Grammatical}

    * Statistics-Based Interpretations
        * Specific Similarity/Edit Distance: Grammatical judgment of a given test item is based on whether the test item is highly similar to a specific learning item ([Vokey & Brooks, 1992](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/replaced_scanned_articles/vokey-brooks92_scanned.pdf))
        * Generalized Context Model: Grammatical judgment of a given test item is based on the averaged similarity between the test item and all learning items ([Pothos & Bailey, 2000](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd_Bailey/publication/12375156_The_Role_of_Similarity_in_Artificial_Grammar_Learning/links/5405ac020cf2c48563b17c30/The-Role-of-Similarity-in-Artificial-Grammar-Learning.pdf))
        * Analogical Similarity: Grammatical judgment of a transfer test item is based on structural similarity with learning items ([Brooks & Vokey](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/pdfs/brooks-vokey91.pdf))
        * Chunk Strength: Grammatical judgment of a given test item is based on whether the test item contains frequent bigrams or trigrams([Knowlton & Squire, 1996](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~pal/pdfs/pdfs/knowlton-squire96.pdf))
        * Entropy: Grammatical judgment of a given test item is based on its entropy value according to all learning items ([Jamieson et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25828458))

### PRESENT EXPERIMENT

#### Independent Variables
1. Grammar Complexity:
    * Finite State grammar
    * Context Free Grammar
2. Chunk Strength: For a given item, chunk strength is the averaged frequency of all its bigrams and trigrams in the learning session

#### Experiment Design
Both standard and transfer settings are used

2 (Grammatical vs. Ungrammatical) x 3 (High, Medium & Low Chunk Strength) x 2 (Changed Module vs. Unchanged Module)
