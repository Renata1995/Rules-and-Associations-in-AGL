## Introduction
###ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR LEARNING PARADIGM (AGL)

* ####Application
  AGL is used to investigate various areas in cognitive psychology, such as implicit learning, contrast between rules and similarity, pattern recognition, categorization.

* ####Implementation
  Prepare an formal grammar (AG): most researchers used a finite state grammar

* #####Training Phase:
  * Participants will observe/memorize a set of items generated by the AG
  * Participants will not be told that strings follow certain rules

* #####Test Phase: 
  * A list of new items is generated. X% follows the AG (Grammatical-G) and 1-x% does not (Ungrammatical-UG)
  * Participants will be told that training strings follow a certain grammar but not details of the grammar
  * Participants will be asked to determine whether new items are G or UG

* #####Normal Results:
  * Participants could exhibit above chance accuracy
  * Participants could not articulate how they make grammaticality judgments.

###Present Experiment Design

####Independent Variables
1. Grammar Complexity
2. Chunk Strength
