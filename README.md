## Introduction
###ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR LEARNING PARADIGM (AGL)

####Application
AGL is used to investigate various areas in cognitive psychology, such as implicit learning, contrast between rules and similarity, pattern recognition, categorization.

####Implementation
Prepare an formal grammar (AG): most researchers used a finite state grammar

#####Training Phase:
a. Participants will observe/memorize a set of items generated by the AG
b. Participants will not be told that strings follow certain rules

#####Test Phase: 
a. A list of new items is generated. 
X% follows the AG (Grammatical-G) and 1-x% does not (Ungrammatical-UG)
b. Participants will be told that training strings follow a certain grammar but not details of the grammar
c. Participants will be asked to determine whether new items are G or UG

#####Normal Results:
a. Participants could exhibit above chance accuracy
b. Participants could not articulate how they make grammaticality judgments.

###Present Experiment Design

####Independent Variables
1. Grammar Complexity
2. Chunk Strength
