## Introduction
### ARTIFICIAL GRAMMAR LEARNING PARADIGM (AGL)

* #### Application
  AGL is used to investigate various areas in cognitive psychology, such as implicit learning, contrast between rules and similarity, pattern recognition, categorization.

* #### Implementation
  Prepare an formal grammar (AG): most researchers used a finite state grammar

* ##### Training Phase:
  * Participants will observe/memorize a set of items generated by the AG
  * Participants will not be told that strings follow certain rules

* ##### Test Phase:
  * A list of new items is generated. X% follows the AG (Grammatical-G) and 1-x% does not (Ungrammatical-UG)
  * Participants will be told that training strings follow a certain grammar but not details of the grammar
  * Participants will be asked to determine whether new items are G or UG

* ##### Normal Results:
  * Participants could exhibit above chance accuracy
  * Participants could not articulate how they make grammaticality judgments.

### PRESENT EXPERIMENT

#### Independent Variables
1. Grammar Complexity:
    * Finite State grammar
    * Context Free Grammar
2. Chunk Strength: For a given item, chunk strength is the averaged frequency of all bigrams and trigrams in the learning session

#### Experiment Design
2 (Grammatical vs. Ungrammatical) x 3 (High, Medium & Low Chunk Strength) x 2 (Changed Module vs. Unchanged Module)
